Why is it useful to put classes inside modules? What do you think?
-Allows for us to keep all related classes in the same namespace (module).

What is accomplished with raise ArgumentError? What do you think it's doing?
-Identifies where errors can be possible and if an error occurs, will either terminate the program or execute the rescue associated with the ArgumentError.


Why do you think we made the .all & .find methods class methods? Why not instance methods?
Because we want them to work before creating a specific instance. They don't modify a specific instance of a class.

-??


Why does it make sense to use inheritance for the different types of accounts?
Because it allows us to inherit class methods from the super class, that create an array of account instances and allow us to match accounts. It also allows us to use instance methods for the parent class and modify them to suit our needs.

- To allow us to utilize and motify instance methods and variables efficiently from the parent class by using 'super' instead creating new methods and variables for each time.


Did the presence of automated tests change the way you thought about the problem? How?

-Yes. The automated tests have made me think about what would make the program run into errors and what errors I should be considering, including results that are not desired. A program can be great with the proper inputs but we have to also make sure that bad inputs are accounted for in some way as well.
